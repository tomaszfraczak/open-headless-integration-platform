# Golden Path and GitOps Delivery Workflow

## Document Purpose
This document outlines the standard delivery lifecycle for integration developers using the Platform. It explains how domain teams build, test, and deploy integrations without relying on a proprietary, closed-source UI portal.

## 1. Git as the Single Pane of Glass

### Philosophy
The platform adopts a **"Lean Platform Engineering"** approach. We do not force developers into a custom-built "Integration Portal" UI. Instead, the version control system (e.g., GitHub/GitLab) serves as the primary developer interface.

### Rationale
Developers are already comfortable with Git, Pull Requests, and IDEs. Building a custom web portal to click "Deploy" adds unnecessary abstraction. By using GitOps, every change—whether it is a line of Java code, a memory limit increase, or a new API route—is tracked, reviewable, and instantly reproducible.

## 2. The Delivery Workflow (Step-by-Step)

When a domain team needs to build a new integration (Tier C), they follow this standardized workflow. This workflow respects the **Responsibility Model**, where the Domain Team focuses solely on delivering code for the *Integration* and *Processing* layers, while the Platform Team manages the underlying CI/CD engine (Automation Layer) and repositories.

### Step 1: Bootstrap via Template (The Golden Path)
Instead of starting from an empty repository and figuring out how to connect to the platform, the developer clicks **"Use this template"** on an official Platform Template Repository (e.g., `platform-camel-quarkus-template`).
* **What it does:** This instantly provisions a repository pre-configured with the correct Maven/Gradle build scripts, Dockerfiles, standard logging dependencies, and Helm charts. The developer immediately starts writing business logic.
* **Naming Conventions Enforcement:** The templates automatically enforce standard naming conventions for new repositories: `platform-[domain]-[service-type]-src` for the source code and `platform-[domain]-gitops` for the manifests.

### Step 2: Local Development and Testing
The developer writes their Apache Camel routes using their preferred IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code).
* **Testing:** Utilizing Camel's native testing frameworks and Quarkus Testcontainers, the integration is verified locally without needing access to the production platform.

### Step 3: Pull Request and CI Validation
Once the logic is ready, the developer opens a Pull Request (PR).
* **Automated Checks:** GitHub Actions (or GitLab CI) automatically run unit tests, enforce code linting, scan for vulnerabilities (e.g., exposed secrets), and validate that the architectural contracts (e.g., OpenAPI specs) are unbroken.
* **Approval:** Senior engineers or domain architects approve the PR.

### Step 4: Merge and GitOps Sync (ArgoCD)
Once merged to the `main` branch, the CI pipeline builds the container image. The image is tagged following the convention `registry.platform.io/[domain]/[service-name]:[tag]` (where the tag is the Git Commit SHA).
* **Registry Validation:** The image is pushed to the **Platform Container Registry (Harbor)**, where it undergoes automated CVE scanning. If critical vulnerabilities are found, the process halts.
* **The Magic:** The developer does *not* run `kubectl apply`. ArgoCD (the GitOps controller residing in the Control Plane's Automation Layer) detects the change in the Git repository and automatically synchronizes the cluster state with the code.

### Step 5: Operations via Native Tools
Post-deployment, developers use standard, best-in-class UI tools provided by the platform:
* **Deployment Status:** Viewed in the ArgoCD UI.
* **Logs & Traces:** Viewed in Grafana/Loki (or the client's compatible swapped component in the Observability Layer).
* **API Metrics:** Viewed in the API Gateway dashboard (Edge Layer).
